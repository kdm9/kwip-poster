  abstract = {Conifers have dominated forests for more than 200 million years and are of huge ecological and economic importance. Here we present the draft assembly of the 20-gigabase genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies), the first available for any gymnosperm. The number of well-supported genes (28,354) is similar to the \ensuremath{>}100 times smaller genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and there is no evidence of a recent whole-genome duplication in the gymnosperm lineage. Instead, the large genome size seems to result from the slow and steady accumulation of a diverse set of long-terminal repeat transposable elements, possibly owing to the lack of an efficient elimination mechanism. Comparative sequencing of Pinus sylvestris, Abies sibirica, Juniperus communis, Taxus baccata and Gnetum gnemon reveals that the transposable element diversity is shared among extant conifers. Expression of 24-nucleotide small RNAs, previously implicated in transposable element silencing, is tissue-specific and much lower than in other plants. We further identify numerous long (\ensuremath{>}10,000 base pairs) introns, gene-like fragments, uncharacterized long non-coding RNAs and short RNAs. This opens up new genomic avenues for conifer forestry and breeding.},

  abstract = {Given a massive collection of sequences, it is infeasible to perform pairwise alignment for basic tasks like sequence clustering and search. To address this problem, we demonstrate that the MinHash technique, first applied to clustering web pages, can be applied to biological sequences with similar effect, and extend this idea to include biologically relevant distance and significance measures. Our new tool, Mash, uses MinHash locality-sensitive hashing to reduce large sequences to a representative sketch and rapidly estimate pairwise distances between genomes or metagenomes. Using Mash, we explored several use cases, including a 5,000-fold size reduction and clustering of all \textasciitilde{}55,000 NCBI RefSeq genomes in 46 CPU hours. The resulting 93 MB sketch database includes all RefSeq genomes, effectively delineates known species boundaries, reconstructs approximate phylogenies, and can be searched in seconds using assembled genomes or raw sequencing runs from Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore. For metagenomics, Mash scales to thousands of samples and can replicate Human Microbiome Project and Global Ocean Survey results in a fraction of the time. Other potential applications include any problem where an approximate, global sequence distance is acceptable, e.g. to triage and cluster sequence data, assign species labels to unknown genomes, quickly identify mis-tracked samples, and search massive genomic databases. In addition, the Mash distance metric is based on simple set intersections, which are compatible with homomorphic encryption schemes. To facilitate integration with other software, Mash is implemented as a lightweight C++ toolkit and freely released under a BSD license at https://github.com/marbl/mash.},

  abstract = {A multiple sequence alignment program, MAFFT, has been developed. The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared with existing methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

  abstract = {We performed whole-genome resequencing of 12 field isolates and eight commonly studied laboratory strains of the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to characterize genomic diversity and provide a resource for studies of natural variation. Our data support previous observations that Chlamydomonas is among the most diverse eukaryotic species. Nucleotide diversity is ∼3\% and is geographically structured in North America with some evidence of admixture among sampling locales. Examination of predicted loss-of-function mutations in field isolates indicates conservation of genes associated with core cellular functions, while genes in large gene families and poorly characterized genes show a greater incidence of major effect mutations. De novo assembly of unmapped reads recovered genes in the field isolates that are absent from the CC-503 assembly. The laboratory reference strains show a genomic pattern of polymorphism consistent with their origin as the recombinant progeny of a diploid zygospore. Large duplications or amplifications are a prominent feature of laboratory strains and appear to have originated under laboratory culture. Extensive natural variation offers a new source of genetic diversity for studies of Chlamydomonas, including naturally occurring alleles that may prove useful in studies of gene function and the dissection of quantitative genetic traits.},

  abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development.

The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match.

Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

  abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

These new options of MAFFT showed higher accuracy than currently available methods including TCoffee version 2 and CLUSTAL W in benchmark tests consisting of alignments of \ensuremath{>}50 sequences. Like the previously available options, the new options of MAFFT can handle hundreds of sequences on a standard desktop computer. We also examined the effect of the number of homologues included in an alignment. For a multiple alignment consisting of ∼8 sequences with low similarity, the accuracy was improved (2–10 percentage points) when the sequences were aligned together with dozens of their close homologues (E-value \ensuremath{<} 10−5–10−20) collected from a database. Such improvement was generally observed for most methods, but remarkably large for the new options of MAFFT proposed here.

  abstract = {Summary: Suffix tree is one of the most fundamental data structures in string algorithms and biological sequence analysis. Unfortunately, when it comes to implementing those algorithms and applying them to real genomic sequences, often the main memory size becomes the bottleneck. This is easily explained by the fact that while a DNA sequence of length n from alphabet Σ = \{A, C, G, T \} can be stored in n log |Σ|= 2n bits, its suffix tree occupies O(n log n) bits. In practice, the size difference easily reaches factor 50.
We provide an implementation of the compressed suffix tree very recently proposed by Sadakane (Theory of Computing Systems, in press). The compressed suffix tree occupies space proportional to the text size, and supports all typical suffix tree operations with at most log n factor slowdown. Our experiments show that, e.g. on a 10 MB DNA sequence, the compressed suffix tree takes 10\% of the space of normal suffix tree. Typical operations are slowed down by factor 60.
Availability: The C++ implementation under GNU license is available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/suds/cst/. An example program implementing a typical pattern discovery task is included. Experimental results in this note correspond to version 0.95.

  doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-12-333},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Counting k-mers (substrings of length k in DNA sequence data) is an essential component of many methods in bioinformatics, including for genome and transcriptome assembly, for metagenomic sequencing, and for error correction of sequence reads. Although simple in principle, counting k-mers in large modern sequence data sets can easily overwhelm the memory capacity of standard computers. In current data sets, a large fraction-often more than 50\%-of the storage capacity may be spent on storing k-mers that contain sequencing errors and which are typically observed only a single time in the data. These singleton k-mers are uninformative for many algorithms without some kind of error correction.
RESULTS: We present a new method that identifies all the k-mers that occur more than once in a DNA sequence data set. Our method does this using a Bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure that stores all the observed k-mers implicitly in memory with greatly reduced memory requirements. We then make a second sweep through the data to provide exact counts of all nonunique k-mers. For example data sets, we report up to 50\% savings in memory usage compared to current software, with modest costs in computational speed. This approach may reduce memory requirements for any algorithm that starts by counting k-mers in sequence data with errors.
CONCLUSIONS: A reference implementation for this methodology, BFCounter, is written in C++ and is GPL licensed. It is available for free download at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/bfcounter.html.},

  abstract = {New sequencing technologies allow genomic variation to be surveyed in much greater detail than previously possible. While detailed analysis of a single individual typically requires deep sequencing, when many individuals are sequenced it is possible to combine shallow sequence data across individuals to generate accurate calls in shared stretches of chromosome. Here, we show that, as progressively larger numbers of individuals are sequenced, increasingly accurate genotype calls can be generated for a given sequence depth. We evaluate the implications of low-coverage sequencing for complex trait association studies. We systematically compare study designs based on genotyping of tagSNPs, sequencing of many individuals at depths ranging between 2× and 30×, and imputation of variants discovered by sequencing a subset of individuals into the remainder of the sample. We show that sequencing many individuals at low depth is an attractive strategy for studies of complex trait genetics. For example, for disease-associated variants with frequency \ensuremath{>}0.2\%, sequencing 3000 individuals at 4× depth provides similar power to deep sequencing of \ensuremath{>}2000 individuals at 30× depth but requires only ∼20\% of the sequencing effort. We also show low-coverage sequencing can be used to build a reference panel that can drive imputation into additional samples to increase power further. We provide guidance for investigators wishing to combine results from sequenced, genotyped, and imputed samples.},

  abstract = {Many algorithms for sequence analysis use patterns or spaced seeds consisting of match and don't-care positions, such that only characters at the match positions are considered when sub-words of the sequences are counted or compared. The performance of these approaches depends on the underlying patterns. Herein, we show that the overlap complexity of a pattern set that was introduced by Ilie and Ilie is closely related to the variance of the number of spaced-word matches between two evolutionarily related sequences, with respect to this pattern set. We propose an improved hill-climbing algorithm to optimize sets of patterns or multiple seeds for database searching, read mapping and alignment-free sequence comparison. Experimental results show that our approach generates seeds with higher sensitivity than existing approaches. In our spaced-words approach to alignment-free sequence comparison, pattern sets calculated with RasBhari led to more accurate estimates of phylogenetic distances than the randomly generated pattern sets that we previously used.

  abstract = {Modern sequencing and genome assembly technologies have provided a wealth of data, which will soon require an analysis by comparison for discovery. Sequence alignment, a fundamental task in bioinformatics research, may be used but with some caveats. Seminal techniques and methods from dynamic programming are proving ineffective for this work owing to their inherent computational expense when processing large amounts of sequence data. These methods are prone to giving misleading information because of genetic recombination, genetic shuffling and other inherent biological events. New approaches from information theory, frequency analysis and data compression are available and provide powerful alternatives to dynamic programming. These new methods are often preferred, as their algorithms are simpler and are not affected by synteny-related problems.
In this review, we provide a detailed discussion of computational tools, which stem from alignment-free methods based on statistical analysis from word frequencies. We provide several clear examples to demonstrate applications and the interpretations over several different areas of alignment-free analysis such as base–base correlations, feature frequency profiles, compositional vectors, an improved string composition and the D2 statistic metric. Additionally, we provide detailed discussion and an example of analysis by Lempel–Ziv techniques from data compression.},

Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation.

  abstract = {Motivation: Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent.
Results: To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use ‘spaced words’, defined by patterns of ‘match’ and ‘don’t care’ positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.

  abstract = {K-mer abundance analysis is widely used for many purposes in nucleotide sequence analysis, including data preprocessing for de novo assembly, repeat detection, and sequencing coverage estimation. We present the khmer software package for fast and memory efficient online counting of k-mers in sequencing data sets. Unlike previous methods based on data structures such as hash tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer relies entirely on a simple probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch. The Count-Min Sketch permits online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in memory which is necessary to support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On sparse data sets this data structure is considerably more memory efficient than any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces a systematic overcount for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the k-mers, are stored. Here we analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the miscount rate of khmer for generating k-mer frequency distributions and retrieving k-mer counts for individual k-mers. We also compare the performance of khmer to several other k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer, Jellyfish, BFCounter, DSK, KMC, Turtle and KAnalyze. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of profiling sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and digital normalization of reads in the context of high khmer false positive rates. khmer is implemented in C++ wrapped in a Python interface, offers a tested and robust API, and is freely available under the BSD license at github.com/ged-lab/khmer.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel method for efficient reconstruction of phylogenetic trees, based on sequences of whole genomes or proteomes, whose lengths may greatly vary. The core of our method is a new measure of pairwise distances between sequences. This measure is based on computing the average lengths of maximum common substrings, which is intrinsically related to information theoretic tools (Kullback–Leibler relative entropy). We present an algorithm for efficiently computing these distances. In principle, the distance of two l long sequences can be calculated in O(l) time. We implemented the algorithm using suffix arrays our implementation is fast enough to enable the construction of the proteome phylogenomic tree for hundreds of species and the genome phylogenomic forest for almost two thousand viruses. An initial analysis of the results exhibits a remarkable agreement with "acceptable phylogenetic and taxonomic truth." To assess our approach, our results were compared to the traditional (single-gene or protein-based) maximum likelihood method. The obtained trees were compared to implementations of a number of alternative approaches, including two that were previously published in the literature, and to the published results of a third approach. Comparing their outcome and running time to ours, using a "traditional" trees and a standard tree comparison method, our algorithm improved upon the "competition" by a substantial margin. The simplicity and speed of our method allows for a whole genome analysis with the greatest scope attempted so far. We describe here five different applications of the method, which not only show the validity of the method, but also suggest a number of novel phylogenetic insights.},

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have become the standard for data generation in studies of population genomics, as the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). However, these techniques are known to be problematic when applied to highly polymorphic genomic regions, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Because accurate genotype calls and allele frequency estimations are crucial to population genomics analyses, it is important to assess the reliability of NGS data. Here, we evaluate the reliability of genotype calls and allele frequency estimates of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported by 1000G (phase I) at five HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1). We take advantage of the availability of HLA Sanger sequencing of 930 of the 1092 1000G samples and use this as a gold standard to benchmark the 1000G data. We document that 18.6\% of SNP genotype calls in HLA genes are incorrect and that allele frequencies are estimated with an error greater than ±0.1 at approximately 25\% of the SNPs in HLA genes. We found a bias toward overestimation of reference allele frequency for the 1000G data, indicating mapping bias is an important cause of error in frequency estimation in this dataset. We provide a list of sites that have poor allele frequency estimates and discuss the outcomes of including those sites in different kinds of analyses. Because the HLA region is the most polymorphic in the human genome, our results provide insights into the challenges of using of NGS data at other genomic regions of high diversity.},

  abstract = {For comparison of whole-genome (genic + nongenic) sequences, multiple sequence alignment of a few selected genes is not appropriate. One approach is to use an alignment-free method in which feature (or l-mer) frequency profiles (FFP) of whole genomes are used for comparison—a variation of a text or book comparison method, using word frequency profiles. In this approach it is critical to identify the optimal resolution range of l-mers for the given set of genomes compared. The optimum FFP method is applicable for comparing whole genomes or large genomic regions even when there are no common genes with high homology. We outline the method in 3 stages: (i) We first show how the optimal resolution range can be determined with English books which have been transformed into long character strings by removing all punctuation and spaces. (ii) Next, we test the robustness of the optimized FFP method at the nucleotide level, using a mutation model with a wide range of base substitutions and rearrangements. (iii) Finally, to illustrate the utility of the method, phylogenies are reconstructed from concatenated mammalian intronic genomes; the FFP derived intronic genome topologies for each l within the optimal range are all very similar. The topology agrees with the established mammalian phylogeny revealing that intron regions contain a similar level of phylogenic signal as do coding regions.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Alignment-based methods for sequence analysis have various limitations if large data sets are to be analysed. Therefore, alignment-free approaches have become popular in recent years. One of the best known alignment-free methods is the average common substring (ACS) approach that defines a distance measure on sequences based on the average length of longest common words between them. Herein, we generalize this approach by considering longest common substrings with k mismatches. We present a greedy heuristic to approximate the length of such k-mismatch substrings and we describe kmacs, an efficient implementation of this idea based on generalized enhanced suffix arrays.
Results: To evaluate the performance of our approach, we applied it to phylogeny reconstruction using a large number of DNA and protein sequence sets. In most cases, phylogenetic trees calculated with kmacs were more accurate than trees produced with established alignment-free methods which are based on exact word matches. Especially on protein sequences, our method seems to be superior. On simulated protein families, kmacs even outperformed a classical approach to phylogeny reconstruction using multiple alignment and maximum likelihood.

  abstract = {The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model system for identifying genes and determining their functions. Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans— the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

However, rigorous quality control practices are needed to avoid high levels of error and bias with these reduced representation methods. We developed a formal statistical framework for filtering spurious loci, using Mendelian inheritance patterns in nuclear families, that accommodates variable-quality genotype calls and missing data—both rampant issues with GBS data—and for identifying sex-linked SNPs. Simulations predict excellent performance of both the Mendelian filter and the sex-linkage assignment under a variety of conditions. We further evaluate our method by applying it to real GBS data and validating a subset of high-quality SNPs. These results demonstrate that our metric of Mendelian inheritance is a powerful quality filter for GBS loci that is complementary to standard coverage and Hardy–Weinberg filters. The described method, implemented in the software MendelChecker, will improve quality control during SNP discovery in nonmodel as well as model organisms.},

Abundant alternative splicing, premature termination codons and novel transcriptionally active regions suggest that post-transcriptional processing forms an important regulatory layer.

We crossed 285 diverse Dent inbred lines from worldwide sources with two testers and predicted their combining abilities for seven biomass-and bioenergy-related traits using 56,110 SNPs and 130 metabolites. Whole-genome and metabolic prediction models were built by fitting effects for all SNPs or metabolites. Prediction accuracies ranged from 0.72 to 0.81 for SNPs and from 0.60 to 0.80 for metabolites, allowing a reliable screening of large collections of diverse inbred lines for their potential to create superior hybrids. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

  abstract = {Motivation: Relationships amongst taxa are inferred from biological data using phylogenetic methods and procedures. Very few known phylogenies exist against which to test the accuracy of our inferences. Therefore, in the absence of biological data, simulated data must be used to test the accuracy of methods which produce these inferences. Researchers have limited or non-existent options for simulations useful for studying the impact of insertions, deletions, and alignments on phylogenetic accuracy.
Results: To satisfy this gap I have developed a new algorithm of indel formation and incorporated it into a new, flexible, and portable application for sequence simulation. The application, called Dawg, simulates phylogenetic evolution of DNA sequences in continuous time using the robust general time reversible model with gamma and invariant rate heterogeneity and a novel length-dependent model of indel formation. On completion, Dawg produces the true alignment of the simulated sequences. Unlike other applications, Dawg allows indel lengths to be explicitly distributed via a biologically realistic power law. Many options are available to allow users to customize their simulations and results. Because simulating with indels would be problematic if biologically realistic parameters could not be estimated, a script is provided with Dawg that can estimate the parameters of indel formation from sequence data. Dawg was applied to the sequences of four chloroplast trnK introns. It was used to parametrically bootstrap an estimation of the rate of indel formation for the phylogeny. Because Dawg can assist in parametric bootstrapping of sequence data it is useful beyond phylogenetics, such as studying alignment algorithms or parameters of molecular evolution.
Availability: Dawg 1.0.0 can be obtained at the following websites: http://www.genetics.uga.edu/sw/ or http://scit.us/dawg/. The package includes source code, example files, a brief manual and helper scripts. Binary distributions are available for Windows and Macintosh OS X.

We show that a standard approach of using the squared-Euclidean distance between \$k\$-mer vectors to approximate a tree metric can be statistically inconsistent. To remedy this, we derive model-based distance corrections for orthologous sequences without gaps, which lead to consistent tree inference. The identifiability of model parameters from \$k\$-mer frequencies is also studied. Finally, we report simulations showing the corrected distance out-performs many other \$k\$-mer methods, even when sequences are generated with an insertion and deletion process. These results have implications for multiple sequence alignment as well, since \$k\$-mer methods are usually the first step in constructing a guide tree for such algorithms.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enables researchers to sequence complex microbial communities directly from environment. Since assembly typically produces only genome fragments, also known as contigs, instead of entire genome, it is crucial to group them into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for further taxonomic profiling and down-streaming functional analysis. OTU clustering is also referred to as binning. We present COCACOLA, a general framework automatically bin contigs into OTUs based upon sequence composition and coverage across multiple samples.
Results: The effectiveness of COCACOLA is demonstrated in both simulated and real datasets in comparison to state-of-art binning approaches such as CONCOCT, GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT. The superior performance of COCACOLA relies on two aspects. One is employing L1 distance instead of Euclidean distance for better taxonomic identification during initialization. More importantly, COCACOLA takes advantage of both hard clustering and soft clustering by sparsity regularization. In addition, the COCACOLA framework seamlessly embraces customized knowledge to facilitate binning accuracy. In our study, we have investigated two types of additional knowledge, the co-alignment to reference genomes and linkage of contigs provided by paired-end reads, as well as the ensemble of both. We find that both co-alignment and linkage information further improve binning in the majority of cases. COCACOLA is scalable and faster than CONCOCT ,GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT

  abstract = {Rapid methods for alignment-free sequence comparison make large-scale comparisons between sequences increasingly feasible. Here we study the power of the statistic D2, which counts the number of matching k-tuples between two sequences, as well as , which uses centralized counts, and , which is a self-standardized version, both from a theoretical viewpoint and numerically, providing an easy to use program. The power is assessed under two alternative hidden Markov models; the first one assumes that the two sequences share a common motif, whereas the second model is a pattern transfer model; the null model is that the two sequences are composed of independent and identically distributed letters and they are independent. Under the first alternative model, the means of the tuple counts in the individual sequences change, whereas under the second alternative model, the marginal means are the same as under the null model. Using the limit distributions of the count statistics under the null and the alternative models, we find that generally, asymptotically  has the largest power, followed by , whereas the power of D2 can even be zero in some cases. In contrast, even for sequences of length 140,000 bp, in simulations  generally has the largest power. Under the first alternative model of a shared motif, the power of  approaches 100\% when sufficiently many motifs are shared, and we recommend the use of  for such practical applications. Under the second alternative model of pattern transfer, the power for all three count statistics does not increase with sequence length when the sequence is sufficiently long, and hence none of the three statistics under consideration can be recommended in such a situation. We illustrate the approach on 323 transcription factor binding motifs with length at most 10 from JASPAR CORE (October 12, 2009 version), verifying that  is generally more powerful than D2. The program to calculate the power of D2,  and  can be downloaded from http://meta.cmb.usc.edu/d2. Supplementary Material is available at www.liebertonline.com/cmb.},

  abstract = {Large-scale comparison of the similarities between two biological sequences is a major issue in computational biology; a fast method, the D(2) statistic, relies on the comparison of the k-tuple content for both sequences. Although it has been known for some years that the D(2) statistic is not suitable for this task, as it tends to be dominated by single-sequence noise, to date no suitable adjustments have been proposed. In this article, we suggest two new variants of the D(2) word count statistic, which we call D(2)(S) and D(2)(*). For D(2)(S), which is a self-standardized statistic, we show that the statistic is asymptotically normally distributed, when sequence lengths tend to infinity, and not dominated by the noise in the individual sequences. The second statistic, D(2)(*), outperforms D(2)(S) in terms of power for detecting the relatedness between the two sequences in our examples; but although it is straightforward to simulate from the asymptotic distribution of D(2)(*), we cannot provide a closed form for power calculations.},

  abstract = {With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, a large amount of short read data has been generated. Assembly of these short reads can be challenging for genomes and metagenomes without template sequences, making alignment-based genome sequence comparison difficult. In addition, sequence reads from NGS can come from different regions of various genomes and they may not be alignable. Sequence signature-based methods for genome comparison based on the frequencies of word patterns in genomes and metagenomes can potentially be useful for the analysis of short reads data from NGS. Here we review the recent development of alignment-free genome and metagenome comparison based on the frequencies of word patterns with emphasis on the dissimilarity measures between sequences, the statistical power of these measures when two sequences are related and the applications of these measures to NGS data.},
